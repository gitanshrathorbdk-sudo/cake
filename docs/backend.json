    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure prioritizes authorization independence and simplifies security rules. User-owned data (songs and playlists) are stored under `/users/{userId}`. This path-based ownership ensures clear authorization boundaries.  Songs are stored directly under the user (`/users/{userId}/songs/{songId}`) enabling easy access and management by the user. Playlists are now stored in a top-level `/playlists` collection to be public to all authenticated users. No `get()` calls are needed in security rules because authorization is based solely on the path and `request.auth.uid`.  The structure directly supports listing songs owned by a user and public playlists. Segregation is achieved by keeping user-specific data under their respective `/users/{userId}` collection.  There are no custom claims, and roles would be stored in the database if there were any. Because there is no data shared between users, a membership map is unnecessary."
